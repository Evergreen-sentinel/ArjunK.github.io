## About me
`Hello my name is Arjun K Indunesh. I do not have a coding background because i had opted for bio maths as my core in my higher secondary. I like to learn more about coding and different ways to implemenet them. I feel coding is tough but also fun to do so i wish to become more better at it and i feel joining AmFoss will help me grow. I cant say any specific reasons on why you should choose me because its my first time in this field so if you would give me an oppurtunity i will try my level best to contribute to the club activites`
